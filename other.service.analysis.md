| **Incident Analysis & Resolution** | As my evening daily routine, I  buyed a veg thali from a meal shop on 23 march 2021. After reaching my home I started eating food ,I ate four chapattis after that i felt that the rice was uncooked and smelly. So the next day I went to the meal shop and complained about rice. The Meal shop owner apologized for his mistake and gave me a 50 % discount on veg thali. |
