| **Incident Analysis & Resolution** | As my evening daily routine, I  buyed a veg thali from a meal shop on 23 march 2021. After reaching my home I started to eat the food. i eated the four chapaties. i felt that the rice was uncooked and smelly .So the next day I went to the same meal shop and complained about rice at the time,the meal shop owner apologized for his mistake and gave me a 50 % discount on my veg thali. |
